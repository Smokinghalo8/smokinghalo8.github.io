</a>
<p>This image was taken last year, like many of the photos on this wall, however, this was taken when we were volenteering at Second Harvest Food Bank!<br>
	I miss those days, it was fun, not that it changed, its just time management :S</p>

	<p>This image was taken at last greek week, When some of the Brothers played flag football, Logan and Alex played pretty damn well!<br>

<!--DND Night-->
<div class="myDivider">
	<h2 class="smallerheading">DnD night!</h2>
	<a href="">
		<img class="images" src="img/dndNight.jpg" alt="DnD Night! Picture 1.", width="650", height="450">
	</a>
	<p>This was taken at the old house, when we played DnD, since we had so many characters joining, we came up with a system<br>
	where we would use two DMs for the start, until a "team captain" member gets introduced to the party, it was only slightly complicated being the main DM...<br>
	jk it was super complicated</p>
	<a href="">
		<img class="images" src="img/dndNight2.jpg" alt="DnD Night! Picture 2.", width="650", height="450">
	</a>
	<p>This was also taken at the old house, and is another picture from DnD Night!</p>
